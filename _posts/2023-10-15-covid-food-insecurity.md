**Question 1: What are the null and alternative hypotheses?**

This study centered around how people's lives specifically related to food insecurity were altered by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The null hypothesis is that Covid-19 has no effect on food insecurity.
The alternative hypothesis is that Covid-19 drastically increased food insecurity.

**Question 2: Who is collecting and analyzing this data?**

Julia A. Wolfson and Cindy W. Leung, the two authors of the research study, collected and analyzed this data using Stata, a data sceince software.

**Question 3: What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?**

This study referenced 38 sources that they used to help conduct their study and share their conclusions.

Some references include:

1. A study of household Food Security in the United States in 2013
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2504067

This study gave data about household food security in the United States in 2013. They used this data to notice that food insecurity typically occurred in households of people of color, lower social standing, and less secure jobs. I assume they also used this data to further understand pre-COVID food insecurity. This dataset is available to the public.

2. Guide to Measuring Household Food Insecurity
https://www.fns.usda.gov/research/guide-measuring-household-food-security-revised-2000

This study was a guide to measuring household food security. The authors used this to determine which households for food secure for measuring their study.

This study also used many datasets available to the public including but not limited to:

-How is each US state handling coronavirus
-Food Insecurity and Mental Illnesses
