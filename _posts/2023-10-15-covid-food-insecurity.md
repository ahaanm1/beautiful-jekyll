**Question 1: What are the null and alternative hypotheses?**

This study centered around how people's lives specifically related to food insecurity were altered by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The null hypothesis is that Covid-19 has no effect on food insecurity.
The alternative hypothesis is that Covid-19 drastically increased food insecurity.

**Question 2: Who is collecting and analyzing this data?**

Julia A. Wolfson and Cindy W. Leung, the two authors of the research study, collected and analyzed this data using Stata, a data sceince software.

**Question 3: What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?**

This study referenced 38 sources that they used to help conduct their study and share their conclusions.

Some references include:

1. A study of household Food Security in the United States in 2013
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2504067

This study gave data about household food security in the United States in 2013. They used this data to notice that food insecurity typically occurred in households of people of color, lower social standing, and less secure jobs. I assume they also used this data to further understand pre-COVID food insecurity. This dataset is available to the public.

2. Guide to Measuring Household Food Insecurity
https://www.fns.usda.gov/research/guide-measuring-household-food-security-revised-2000

This study was a guide to measuring household food security. The authors used this to determine which households for food secure for measuring their study.

This study also used many datasets available to the public including but not limited to:

-How is each US state handling coronavirus
-Food Insecurity and Mental Illnesses
-Food insecurity is associated with chronic disease among low-income NHANES participants


**Question 4: Why are they interested in this data?**

The two women who conducted this study both work in departments related to food insecurity in Nutritional Sciences and Health Management and Policy. Adding on, this article was published in June of 2020, and Covid was just starting to impact the world in the couple months before which means there wouldn't be as much information online. This lack of information gives the authors the ability to make meaningful data collection that isn't already on the internet. Thus, an article related to food insecurity impacted by Covid would be interesting to the authors as well as interesting to the public.

**Question 5: What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?**

**Data Collected**:
All of this is compared to with different levels of food insecurity
-Age
-Sex
-Race
-Household Size
-Marital Status
-Children in Household
-Income
-Highest Level of Education
-Student
-House Ownership
-Health Insurance
-Political Party
-SNAP benefits
-Region of Residence
-US adults that stocked up 2 weeks of food(Public Health Recommendations)
At different levels of food insecurity: percent that 
-Don't have enough food to feed myself/my family
-Can't get essential household items
-Don't have enough money to pay bills
-Don't have enough money to pay rent/mortgage
-Can't get medications
-Can't get healthcare I need
-Don't have enough childcare
-Haven't been able to work due to lack of childcare 
-Haven't been able to work because I have been sick
There are also more questions related to COVID in the workplace at different levels of food insecurity

For the data they wanted to collect, they answered all major questions. In order to fully capture food insecurity other than figure 2 about 2 weeks of food, I think it would be good to use the Food Insecurity Experience Scale, which asks 8 questions that could help the data analyzers to conclusively understand the difference Covid-19 is making within food insecurity.

**Question 6: What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?**

This study has data through a national survey of different food insecurity levels in low-income adults. Through the tables and figures you can already see the impact Covid has made on the general population. 

Quote: "Our findings show that as early as mid-March 2020, food-insecure adults currently working outside the home were at greater risk of losing their income or their jobs if they got sick from COVID-19. Regardless of whether they get sick or their employment status, food-insecure individuals were also more likely to report expecting that they will lose income during the pandemic."

Evidence: Firstly, in table 2 data was collected from March 19-24. This was when Covid was just starting and at this time, already 41% of people said they don't have sick days and if they don't go to work they will lose income. 20% of people said their workplace was temporarily closed that early into Covid. 4% of people's workplace closed and they were fired. This evidence supports their claim: 

Quote with Evidence: "In 2018, 11.1% of adults in the US were food insecure; among low-income adults (<185% FPL), 29.1% were food insecure. We find that, as of mid-March, 2020, 44% of adults with an income <250% of the FPL were food insecure in the past 30 days, and these individuals were more likely to be non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic."

They mentioned the evidence they used which comes from table 1 to back up the conclusion that due to COVID more people are food insecure and a majority of those are Hispanic or Black.

Quote with Evidence: "Fifty-four percent of food secure adults reported they expected their income would remain the same compared to 23% of adults with very low food security (results not shown, but available upon request)"

They use this data to demonstrate that COVID affected many people's incomes especially those with lower food security. Even though these results aren't shown, they are available upon request so I don't think this is falsified.


**Question 7: How was this study funded?**

This study was funded by a Faculty Research Grant from the University of Michigan Poverty Solutions. This makes sense since the two authors work at the University of Michigan.

**Question 8: Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?**

After reviewing this article thoroughly, I don't think publish or perish had an effect in all aspects of this article. From the authors' perspectives, they work in departments related to this type of research, and when Covid-19 became significant, it was important to understand how it affects the lives of US citizens. This article, through a survey, was able to capture significant effects of Covid such as Food Security, Basic Needs Challenges, Workplace Reactions, and Employment and Income. This data was necessary to the public health departments throughout the country because it offers insight to find ways of combating food insecurity especially during the pandemic. Adding on, since this was a survey based study, and all the results add up to 1478(the number of survey participants), this data wasn't picked out to match their hypothesis. I also don't think there was any sort of p-hacking in this data collection since the p-values that they used to make conclusions were significantly below the 0.05 value. I also do not think there is a necessity for p-hacking since this data is relatively new, so any result could be perceived as interesting whether there was no effect or even if Covid improved food security. Overall, this article had significant data that helps people understand the role of Covid on food security throughout the country.
