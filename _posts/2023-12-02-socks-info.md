##1. Discuss how you used the API to obtain the dataset.

For this lab, I was given a dataset that I needed to obtain from Google Sheets into a dictionary on my console.

First, I needed to import the python package, requests, which allows me to work with API's. Python requests is a library for making HTTP requests and allows you to easily work with HTTP.
